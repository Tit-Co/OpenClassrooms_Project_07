## ALGORITHMS - OpenClassrooms Project 07
**Solve problems using algorithms in Python**

---

## DESCRIPTION

This project was completed as part of the "Python Developer" path at OpenClassrooms.

The goal was to develop an application based on algorithms capable of:
- Maximizing clients profits after a 2-year investment.

The application must include:
- A brute-force algorithm, initially
- An optimized version, then
- And finally, a version optimized and retrospectively tested on historical company files.
