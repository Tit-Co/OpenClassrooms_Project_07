## ALGORITHMS - OpenClassrooms Project 07
**Solve problems using algorithms in Python**

---

## DESCRIPTION

This project was completed as part of the "Python Developer" path at OpenClassrooms.

The goal was to develop an application based on algorithms capable of:
- Maximizing clients profits after a 2-year investment.

The application must include:
- A brute-force algorithm, initially
- An optimized version, then
- And finally, a version optimized and retrospectively tested on historical company files.

## INSTALLATION

### - Clone the repository :
`git clone https://github.com/Tit-Co/OpenClassrooms_Project_04.git`

### - Navigate into the project directory :
`cd OpenClassrooms_Project_04`

### - Create a virtual environment and dependencies :
#### Option 1 - with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

`uv` is an environment and dependencies manager.

### - Install environment and dependencies

`uv sync`

#### Option 2 - with pip

### - Install the virtual env :

`python -m venv env`

### - Activate the virtual env :
`source env/bin/activate`  
Or  
`env\Scripts\activate` on Windows  

### - Install dependencies 
#### Option 1 - with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

`uv pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

#### Option 2 - with pip

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## USAGE

### Launch each Python file in the console
Examples: 
`python bruteforce.py`
`python optimized.py`
